I know...). That will change once we are able to build our office/game room, but that's another story.</p> <p>I installed it, configured, loved it. I thought, now if I switch ISPs or they need to change my router for some reason, I don't have to do any changes in my devices, since they will always be connected to the router. Or at least that's what I thought...</p> <p>I have always been a bit annoyed by routers having two SSID, one for 2.4 GHz and one for 5 GHz, because you see twice as many networks everywhere, so when I saw the option to have a single SSID that offers both, I immediately turned that on. It was pretty nice, my phone wouldn't randomly lose WiFi on the second floor because it lost connection to the 5 GHz and connected to the 2.4 GHz one. Changing it required reconnecting every device at home to the new network, once again... but I figured it was worth it.</p> <p>The change was a bit harder on some IoT devices, like lightbulbs, because they can only connect to 2.4 GHz, so some would keep saying it was a 5 GHz network.</p>","tags":["Nintendo Switch","Troubleshooting","Networking"]},{"location":"2025/08/01/networking-beginner-vs-nintendo-switch/#finding-a-solution","title":"Finding a solution","text":"<p>The first step was to again split the WiFi network into separate SSIDs for each band.

Oddly enough I ended up finding some answers in a deals community (Mexican version of Pepper). Basically the issue was that Nintendo Switch can only see WiFi channels under 149, and my router was using exactly channel 149.</p> <p>I changed that to channel 36, and some seconds later, the 5 GHz network showed up on my Switch.

However, at my previous job, I was provided with a MacBook. One of the things I enjoyed from it was the Spotlight feature (Cmd+Space). So when I saw that Power Toys had a similar tool, I gave it a try.</p> <p></p> <p>Definitely not as pretty as Spotlight... but still very handy.</p> <p>The default shortcut is Ctrl+Space, and you can start typing immediately. I personally use it mostly as a quick calculator and sometimes as a quick search.</p> <p>The way this works is by using plugins. It comes with plenty of bundled plugins, and for each of them, you can decide whether you want it to be included in global results or require an activation command. For example, the activation command for Windows Settings is <code>$</code>, and it is not set to Include in global results, so I need to put <code>$</code> at the beginning in order to show results from this plugin.</p> <p></p> <p>This way you can select which plugins always show results and which one require explicit intent, so you don't end up with way too many results. For example, I have the Calculator plugin included in results, so I can just type <code>5+5</code> and get the answer. I can then press Enter to copy the result to the clipboard.</p> <p>These are my main plugins</p> <ul> <li>Calculator: Sometimes I just want quick math on the spot, and being able to copy it to the clipboard is amazing.</li> <li>Unit Converter: Very similar to Calculator, but for unit conversions. Saves me the trouble of using Google. Although it is a shame that it doesn't include currency conversion.</li> <li>Windows Search: Searches files and folders. I don't use this as often, because I usually rely on Everything.</li> <li>Program: Searches programs, so you can use this as an application launcher.</li> </ul> <p>Other plugins worth mentioning:</p> <ul> <li>Value Generator: I'm gonna be honest here, I didn't know this one existed, but this looks very handy if you are a developer. It can generate UUIDs, encode and decode URLs, MD5, sha256, etc.</li> <li>Windows Terminal: Shortcut to open Windows Terminal profiles.</li> <li>Window Walker: This one seems very handy, I have tried it a couple of times, but doesn't seem like my style. It lets you search among your open windows to jump to them.</li> </ul> <p>You can also install third-party plugins. There are some in the GitHub Repository.

I saw Caddy being used at my job and I was curious about it so I wanted to give it a try. That was really my reason for switching. You could say that\u2019s the reason for most of the things I do: curiosity. I was previously using nginx installed directly on the system, so I had to dig for configuration every time I wanted to change something, but with Caddy I decided to use a Docker container to have it all centralized.</p> <p>The networking was pretty simple, some would argue this isn't very secure, and I agree, but I think that's the whole point of the experience. A single <code>remotelab</code> Docker network to rule them all. No exposed ports, just Caddy as the central receiver, routing requests to the appropriate container.</p> <p>Along with Caddy, I set up OAuth2 Proxy, as I wanted a way to make some sites only available to me. I tried to set up Traefik as well, but I could never get it to play along well with OAuth2 Proxy.</p> <p>At this point, my remote lab was just the apps that have survived my cleanup.
